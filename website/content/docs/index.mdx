# ccdbind + ccdpin

CPU affinity management tools for Linux gaming, designed for AMD processors with multiple Core Complex Dies (CCDs).

<Callout type="info">
  These tools automatically detect your CPU topology and optimize game performance by isolating game workloads from OS tasks.
</Callout>

## The Problem

On AMD CPUs with multiple CCDs (like Ryzen 9 or Threadripper), processes can migrate between CCDs during execution. Each CCD has its own L3 cache, so cross-CCD migration causes cache misses and performance degradation.

Games are particularly sensitive to this because:
- They have tight frame timing requirements
- Background OS tasks compete for the same cores
- Cache thrashing from core migration causes stuttering

## The Solution

**ccdbind** and **ccdpin** solve this by:

1. **Detecting CCD groups** via L3 cache topology from sysfs
2. **Pinning OS slices** (`app.slice`, `background.slice`) to one CCD group
3. **Dedicating game processes** to a separate CCD group with exclusive L3 cache access

## Two Tools, Two Approaches

### When to Use Which?

| Use Case | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| "Set and forget" automatic management | `ccdbind` |
| Per-game control via Steam launch options | `ccdpin` |
| Both automatic + manual overrides | Both together |

## Quick Start

<Steps>
### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/quicksetd
cd quicksetd
./install.sh
```

### Verify

```bash
ccdbind status
```

### (Optional) Use with Steam

Add to your game's launch options:
```
ccdpin %command%
```
</Steps>

## Requirements

- Linux with systemd (user session)
- AMD CPU with multiple CCDs (or manual CPU group configuration)
- Go 1.21+ (for building from source)
